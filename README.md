# Google-Doc-Github-Add-on
## Project Overview:

The goal of our project was to build a google doc Github add-on which can be utilized by users to extract key information from their Github repository via a simple and easy to use User interface.

Monitoring commits and extracting key information about specific commits if any conflict arises can be difficult for most new developers working on a collaborative project. Command-line git commands are tricky and require some memorization. 
Our vision is to help these young developers through the use of our add-on. 

Our add-on offers functionalities to list information (committer name, commit date, message, and reference number) about all commits made to a repository between a range of dates, get detailed information about a specific commit, and also compare commits between two branches.
